## Introduction
*Stim.js is a lightweight, framework agnostic, JavaScript front-end framework designed to accelerate and add interactivity to server side rendering (SSR) apps.*

Be productive! 🙂 Write your application the "old fashioned" way with the server rendering HTML and receiving postbacks, and then use Stim.js to make it feel like a modern single-page application. 

## Stim.js is...
 - **Lightweight:** a single file with zero dependencies and written in pure JavaScript.
 - **Framework agnostic**: does not require any server side integration, and any optional integration is done through HTML attributes and generic request parameters. 
 - **An optional drop in:** it encourages you to design your application so that even if JavaScript is disabled, your application's core functionality will continue to work.
